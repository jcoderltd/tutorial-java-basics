# tutorial-java-basics

This is the example project used as reference in the https://jcoder.io/content/course/java/beginners - Java 8 for Beginners Course.

This project contains a set of example classes used in different chapters in the course and shouldn't be used as reference code. The classes and code in this project are designed to introduce concepts in different stages of the course and hence they don't follow best practices.
